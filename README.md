# JobFlow-AI

AI-powered job application automation with a native desktop UI.

## Overview

JobFlow-AI automates the entire job application loop: searching job boards, filling application forms, uploading resumes, submitting applications, and learning from each interaction so it gets better over time. Everything runs locally on your machine — your data never leaves your computer.

## Features

- **Native desktop app** — macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Plugin-based job sources** — LinkedIn, Indeed, and other job boards via YAML plugins. Write your own plugin for any site in minutes with no code required.
- **Global ATS support** — 30+ applicant tracking systems (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, iCIMS, SmartRecruiters, Taleo, and more). The self-learning memory system transfers knowledge across all sites using the same ATS.
- **18 countries, 11 languages** — Country-aware profiles with date formats, currencies, work authorization, and notice periods. Auto-detects language from your country.
- **Job collection** — AI browser agent searches selected platforms for jobs matching your target titles and locations.
- **Automated applications** — AI agent fills forms, uploads your resume, answers screening questions from its Q&A bank. Multiple workers can run in parallel.
- **AI cover letter generation** — One-click tailored cover letters using your LLM, customized per job description.
- **Tailored resumes** (beta) — Auto-customizes your resume for each job description.
- **Self-learning memory** — Stores per-ATS procedural knowledge (navigation patterns, form strategies, UI quirks). Lessons from one Workday site apply to all Workday sites globally.
- **Smart Q&A reuse** — Learns answers from previous applications and reuses them.
- **Multi-LLM support** — OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, or OpenRouter (100+ models).
- **Dashboard** — Real-time stats, success rates, per-domain performance, memory impact analysis.
- **CLI tools** — Power-user scripts for collection, application, memory management, and analytics.
- **100% local** — All data stored on your machine in your OS app data directory.

## Quick Start

1. **Download and install** from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vishnu/JobFlow-AI/releases) section below
2. **Open the app** — Chromium downloads automatically on first launch (~400 MB, one time)
3. **Setup wizard** walks you through: **LLM provider** → **Resume upload** (auto-parses your profile) → **Review profile** → Ready
4. **Collect jobs** — go to **Jobs** → enter a job title → **Start Collecting**
5. **Apply** — go to **Apply** → **Start Applying** and watch the dashboard as applications roll in

## How It Works

JobFlow-AI runs a three-stage loop: **Collect → Apply → Learn**.

**Collect** — An AI browser agent logs into LinkedIn (or your chosen platform), searches for jobs matching your target titles and locations, and saves each listing with its URL, company, title, and description.

**Apply** — For each pending job, the agent opens the application (Easy Apply or external ATS), fills every field using your profile, uploads your resume, answers screening questions from its Q&A bank, and submits. Multiple workers can run in parallel.

**Learn** — After each application, the system extracts procedural learnings: which buttons to click, how forms are structured, what fails and what works. These memories are stored per-ATS domain with confidence scores, so next time it encounters the same ATS, it already knows how to navigate it.

### Data Storage

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/jobflow-ai/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/jobflow-ai/` |
| Linux | `~/.config/jobflow-ai/` |

All data is stored locally in your operating system's application data directory.

## Quick Start

1. **Download and install** from the [Download](#download) section above
2. **Open the app** — Chromium downloads automatically on first launch (~400 MB, one time)
3. **Setup wizard** walks you through: **LLM provider** → **Resume upload** (auto-parses your profile) → **Review profile** → Ready
4. **Collect jobs** — go to **Jobs** → enter a job title → **Start Collecting**
5. **Apply** — go to **Apply** → **Start Applying** and watch the dashboard as applications roll in

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Node.js | 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Rust | 1.77+ | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| Python | 3.13+ | [python.org](https://python.org) |
| uv | latest | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishnu/JobFlow-AI.git
cd JobFlow-AI

npm install                                    # Node dependencies
uv sync                                        # Python dependencies
uv run python -m playwright install chromium   # Browser engine
```

### Run in Development

Two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 -- Python backend
uv run python backend/main.py

# Terminal 2 -- Frontend dev server
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:1420, or run as a native desktop app instead:

# Terminal 2 (alternative) -- Native Tauri app
cargo tauri dev
```

> The first `cargo tauri dev` compiles the Rust shell (~2 min). Subsequent runs are fast.

### Build for Production

```bash
cargo tauri build
```

Produces platform-specific installers in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

```bash
# Collect jobs from LinkedIn
uv run python cli/collect_jobs.py

# Apply to jobs (3 parallel workers)
uv run python cli/apply_jobs.py --workers 3

# Apply with per-job tailored resumes
uv run python cli/apply_jobs_tailored.py --workers 2

# Memory management
uv run python cli/memory_cli.py stats
uv run python cli/memory_cli.py domains
uv run python cli/memory_cli.py show linkedin.com

# Terminal performance dashboard
uv run python cli/dashboard.py
```
